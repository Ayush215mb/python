Project Title: Social Media Parsing Tool for
Investigative Analysis
1. Introduction
In todayâ€™s digital age, social media platforms have become a treasure trove of information, often
serving as critical evidence in criminal investigations. Law enforcement agencies need to efficiently
collect, analyze, and document this data, ensuring accuracy and reliability while maintaining data
security. The proposed Social Media Parsing Tool addresses these needs by providing an automated
solution to parse, extract, and document data from various social media platforms, focusing initially
on a Windows-based application. The tool will streamline the process of gathering social media
evidence, reducing the risk of human error, and increasing the speed and efficiency of investigations.
2. Problem Statement
During investigation when the social media accounts of accused/suspect are opened for examination
or creating Panchnamas, it would be better if some tool is designed which can automatically parse the
data and provide the screenshot of the posts, messages, timeline, friend list, following, followers,
account info, etc and provide screenshots in a documented form.
* The examiner may choose to print the screenshots as per requirements. This will omit any human
error during the process and also help to thoroughly reviewing the data found for the said social media
account.
* Separate options for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp, Google account etc may
be provided in the tool.
* Many a times, the social media accounts do not open in Desktops even if we have the right
credentials and the examiner have to use a dummy android phone. So, two separate versions (Android
and windows) of this tool will be helpful.
